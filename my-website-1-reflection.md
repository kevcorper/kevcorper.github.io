# 1.6 Making a Website

##Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.

##Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

To create a repository on GitHub, you navigate to your account page and click the + button in the top right corner and select "new repository" and fill in the form appropriately.  To clone this repository to your local computer, first copy the https URL listed for your new repository.  Now use your relevant command line, make sure your current director is correct, and type 'git clone [URL name]'.  Now your new repository is cloned in the specified directory on your local computer!

##Describe what open source means.

Open Source is a way for developers to share code and files with online communities, allowing for other developers to not only use this code for their own benefit, but also to update the code as they see fit and recommend changes to the original developer.

##What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

I think open source is amazing!  It does not make me particularly nervous or protective, but then again, I have not quite created anything of unique value to feel protectice about yet.  To me, open source is what the internet was meant to be--an online community where the sharing of ideas is an open community meant to build amazing things through the contribution of any interested party.  It does feel a bit utopian, and I am sure problems arise every now and then and it can never be perfect--but what's wrong with at least trying to make an online presence as close to utopia as possible?

##Assess the importance of using licenses.

Licenses interestingly do not only protect your work in the open source community, they can also give more freedom to users that want to utilize your code!  Copyright laws are inherent, espeically in the USA, and a variety of open source licenses are available to users that give the developer community access to your code legally.  These licenses can give other developers anywhere from complete freedom with your code to limited access.

##What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

I am pretty stubborn and it takes me a while to feel that a concept is solidified for me, but I do feel a bit more comfortable with git.  I am surprised to find that git is what I struggle with the most at the moment, and although my understanding is getting better with every command I make, it does make me nervous not having a complete grasp.  I am going to utilize some of the online materials to better wrap my mind around the concept over the next few days in order to review it.

##Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Although I have not browsed it very much as of yet, I found this git tutorial quite useful in the way it breaks up concepts: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/
