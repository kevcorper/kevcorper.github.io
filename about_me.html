  <p>I grew up in the amazing city of Cincinnati, Ohio and attended college not too far away at The Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio.  I receieved my Bachelor's in Speech and Hearing Sciences in 2013. I chose this obscure degree because of a mixture of a passion for learning and a desire to involve myself with a science.  I ultimately found myself growing tired of the regulations and expectations that come with a career in both health and teaching (the fields I was considering), and decided to throw myself in to something completely new after graduation.</p>
  <p>After much research and agony, I stumbled upon the idea of development.  I had always dabbled with computer science throughout my life, but never truly considered myself worthy of an engineering or development title.  This time around, however, I did not let these defeatist thoughts spoil my goals.  I found myself actually enjoying reading about languages and practicing mini programs on my own--which ultimately led to me discovering bootcamp schools like Dev Bootcamp in New York City, where I am currently attending school and bettering myself as a programmer.</p>
  <p>Life story aside...in a nutshell I am an extremely driven individual that is so amazingly stoked to begin a career in development.  I believe I am a great asset to any development team as long as our values are in line with one another.  The end objective is employment within a progressive organization that values innovation, teamwork and overall, compassion.</p>
