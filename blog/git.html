  <h2>Version Control</h2>

              <b>Version Control</b><br>
              Version Control allows for a developer to not only track changes as they continue to update their code, but also can provide a complete history of changes made to an outside developer that wishes to update, review or revise your code.  This all makes open source code online much more simple, as the sharing of code with its history of updates and "versions" makes for a more streamlined process of sharing code and merging changes.
              </p>
            <p>
              <b>git</b><br>
              Git is a piece of software run from the command line that allows for a developer to keep track of these changes and utilize version control.  With git, the developer works on their project while simultaneously updating commits, which are essentially snapshots of the code that save where the developer was at.  Git then keeps a log of these commits, which allows for the user to review past commits and revert to earlier version if a mistake is made or the user decides they liked the earlier version better.  Ultimately, git is great in giving the user a backup in case of any accidents.
              </p>
              <p>
              <b>GitHub</b><br>
              GitHub is an online remote community that not only allows for social networking between developers, but is an amazing repository for code that allows for seamless team coding, code storage, and open sourcing of code.  This allows for users to share their own repositories, fork and branch from other user's repositories, and ultimately merge any updates made by others.  GitHub is an excellent way to store code all while sharing and exploring the projects of others.
