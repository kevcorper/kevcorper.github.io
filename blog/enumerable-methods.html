  <h2>Ruby: Enumerable Methods</h2>
  <h3>February 17, 2016</h3>
  <section id="blogpost">
          <p>
              <b>#map</b><br>
              map can be used to invoke a block of code on to each element of an array and return a new array with the changed values.  Another method that works just like map is called collect, which conducts the exact enumerator process.
              </p>
            <p>
              <b>#group_by</b><br>
              group_by is used to returns hash of grouped values from an input collection.  A block of code is used to analyze each element in the collection and the results/answers to the block are stored as keys, while the number themselves are grouped into arrays and stored as the values within the keys corresponding to their result.  An example would be to run a block of code with the group_by method on a collection of numbers 1-4, withe block specifying "i%2".  This would result in 2 groups within the hash: the first with a key of 0 and objects 2 and 4, the second with a key of 1 and objects 1 and 3.
              </p>
              <p>
              <b>#cycle</b><br>
              cycle also conducts a block of code on to each element, but it also can take in an argument of how many times you would like to cycle through the input.  cycle will return nil if the cycle is conducted with no interruptions.  If no argument is given, the cycle loops forever.  An example would be to call cycle on an array of [1,2] for 3 cycles with a block asking to puts the current element.  This would results in an output of "1 2 1 2" on separate lines.
