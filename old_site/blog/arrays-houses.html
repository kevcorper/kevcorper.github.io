  <h2>Arrays and Hashes</h2>
  <h3>February 11, 2016</h3>

              <b>Arrays</b><br>
              Arrays are used to store information and can be thought of as ordered lists.  The information is placed into brackets and separated by commas.  In terms of what objects an array can store...they can really store anything!  Integers, strings, other arrays, variables pointing to other objects, etc. can all be placed into an array. In order to reference an object within an array, indexing is used, which uses a specific numbering system, beginnng with zero, to locate an object.  An example of this is: array[0], which would fetch the first item in an array.

              <b>Hashes</b><br>
               Hashes are also used to store information and can be looked at as lists, but are a bit more unordered than arrays.  This does not make them nonspecific, however.  In fact, hashes use symbols as keywords to represent certain values for referencing.  Therefore, referencing the value of a keyword of "name" would simply be written as hash[name].

              <b>Which one is better?</b><br>
              Neither!  Arrays and hashes are both extremely useful in different situations.  Most notably, arrays are useful when your focus is on a set of objects where their identifications do not matter as much as their order does (especially when you have repeating values).  Hashes are most useful when the objects need more information than standalone values, so keys can come in to play and help define each value uniquely.
