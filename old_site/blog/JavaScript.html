  <h2>Javascript vs. Ruby</h2>

              <b>Javascript Loops</b><br>
              Loops in Javascript have much more limited options than Ruby.  In Javascript, the looping devices that exist are while and for loops.  While loops use a condition that must be true to continue looping through a block of code.  For loops specify an index counter (which is a common need in programming), a conditional, and a counter manipulator, which is often used to iterate through arrays and objects.  Examples of these loops can be seen below.

              <b>While Loop Example</b><br>
              <p class = "code">
                var x = true<br>
                <br>
                while (x) {<br>
                console.log("This will print once")<br>
                x = false<br>
                };<br>
                <br>
                => "This will print once"
              </p>
              </p>
              <p>
              <b>For Loop Example</b><br>
              <p class = "code">
                for (i = 0; i < 5; i++)<br>
                console.log(i);<br>
                <br>
                => 0<br>
                => 1<br>
                => 2<br>
                => 3<br>
                => 4<br>
              </p>
              </p>
            <p>
              <p>
              <b>In Comparison to Ruby</b><br>
              Ruby offers plenty more looping capabilities than Javascript in terms of built-in methods.  The most notable of these being the each method that iterates through arrays and hashes, and the collection of enumerables that come along with it.  Javascript has similar enumerable-like methods for some of the objects (such as map), but it does rely heavier on more from-scratch methods than Ruby.
