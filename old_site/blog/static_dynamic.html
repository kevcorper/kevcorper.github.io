  <h2>Static vs. Dynamic Typing</h2>
  <h3>March 9, 2016</h3>
  <section id="blogpost">
            <p>
              <b>Type</b><br>
              <p>It is important to note here that typing in this case does not refer to the actual punching of keys on a computer keyboard, but rather refers to data type.  In this case, static and dynamic are versions of typing--languages using static and dynamic typing are considered <em>static typed</em> or <em>dynamic typed</em>.</p>
              <p>A well-documented difference between these types are the ways in which type checking is done, whether at compile-time or run-time.  This results in the most important functional difference, which is the point at which variables are checked.</p>
              </p>
            <p>
              <b>Static</b><br>
              <p>Static-typed languages conduct variable checking at compile-time.  This means that variables do not actually have to be defined before they are used.  Since variables can be used without intitial definition, this means that static languages imply the need of explicit declaration of variables before they are utilized.</p>
              <p>Examples of static-typed languages are <b>C</b>, <b>C++</b> and <b>Java</b>.
              </p>
            <p>
              <p>
              <b>Dynamic</b><br>
              <p>Dynamic-typed languages conduct variable checking at run-time.  This means that variables do have to be defined before use.  Unlike static-typed languages, however, no explicit declaration of variables in necessary to begin utilizing variables.</p>
              <p>Examples of dynamic-typed languages are <b>Python</b>, <b>Ruby</b> and <b>PHP</b>.</p>
             </p>
             <b>Which is better?</b><br>
              <p>Neither, of course are inherently better than the other.  A major pro of dynamic languages is the shorter code and the less time required to define and initialize variables.  This however also leads to its major con, which is that without having to initially explicitly declare variables, it is very easy to make simple typing and misspelling errors and not realize it.  Ultimately, it is contested by programmers and many promote one over the other, but it really comes down to personal preference: would you rather have the simplicity yet free realm of a dynamic language or the strictness yet overseeing structure of a static language?</p>
