##What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
I feel that I have a much better grasp of the box model after this challenge.  Using padding to enlarge the box links for my blog posts, adding borders on the bottom of an element to create a line break and adding margins to better position elements were all things I leanred.

##What did you learn about CSS positioning?
I learned more about positioning in terms of static/fixed/etc., but I still find them very confusing when understanding which positioning properties can be associated with certain elements.  I also learned more about the display property and block/inline elements.

##What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
I found the colors and aesthic aspect easy to implement, as I enjoy design and I naturally have a minimalist taste (making my site's template relatively simple to stylize).  I found positioning the most difficult, and I although I still don't have as great of a grasp on it that I would like--I do feel that I am much better at CSS after this challenge.

##What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
I mostly learned about how elements work, whether they are block or inline, and how to stylize elements to create an interface in creative ways (such as creating a line divider with a bottom border).
